If a candidate knows why they were rejected, their confidence will improve for future opportunities. They won't think the interview was unfair, the interviewer was rude, or the company's process was bad. A good interview will always give the candidate useful experience, making the time spent by both parties worthwhile.

A successful interview is a two-way street, requiring effort and understanding from both the candidate and the interviewer. From a candidate's perspective, a good interview involves several key elements before, during, and after the actual meeting.

## Before the Interview

### Clear Communication

**Advance Notice:** Candidates often take leave from work or adjust their schedules to attend an interview. If there's a chance the interview might be cancelled, they should be informed in advance to avoid unnecessary disruptions.

**Preparation Tips:** If possible, recruiters should provide a heads-up about the topics or types of questions that will be asked.

**Flexibility:** In case of an emergency on the candidate's end, recruiters should be considerate and willing to reschedule.

**Empathy for New Candidates:** For those just starting their careers, a little empathy goes a long way, as this may be their first interview experience.

### Professionalism and Punctuality

Candidates expect interviewers to be on time and respectful of their schedule, though exceptions can be made for both parties.

## During the Interview

**Introduction and Company Overview:** An introduction from the interviewer and a brief overview of the company can help reduce the candidate's nervousness.

**Friendly Demeanour:** Being friendly can significantly lower a candidate's anxiety, allowing them to answer questions more comfortably.

**Patience and Guidance:** If a candidate goes off-topic or provides more information than needed, the interviewer should be patient and guide them back on track.

**Avoiding Ego:** Interviewers should avoid letting ego interfere. If something is wrong, they should correct it and move on.

**Allowing Candidates to Highlight Strengths:** Candidates often don't get the chance to discuss what they are most confident about. Interviewers should allow candidates to speak about their strengths, boosting their confidence for subsequent questions.

**Clear and Progressive Questions:** Interviewers should start with clear questions to help candidates gain confidence before moving on to more complex ones.

**Encouraging Questions:** New candidates should be encouraged to ask questions during the interview.

**Reassuring Candidates:** Asking candidates to share their thought processes, whether right or wrong, helps reduce nervousness and build confidence.

**Staying Relevant:** Interviewers should stay relevant to the job description and the candidate's resume.

**Providing Feedback:** Constructive feedback or small hints during the interview can be beneficial.

## After the Interview

### Timely Communication

**Updates:** Candidates appreciate prompt updates about the status of their application and next steps.

**Feedback:** Providing constructive feedback on their performance, where possible, can be very valuable.

### Respect for Their Time

**Efficiency:** Candidates expect the interview process to be efficient, minimizing unnecessary delays.

### Transparency about the Role and Company

**Information Sharing:** Candidates want to learn about the role, team, company culture, and career growth opportunities. Recruiters should proactively share this information, especially for candidates early in their careers who might hesitate to ask.

**Realistic Preview:** Providing a realistic job preview helps candidates understand what to expect if they join.

**Consistency:** Maintaining professionalism at every stage of the interview process leaves a positive impression on candidates.

**Empathy:** Interviewers need to understand that candidates are human; they may know some things and not others.

## Key Takeaways

By understanding these expectations and incorporating them into their interview process, interviewers can create a more positive and effective experience for candidates, ultimately attracting and retaining top talent.

Creating a positive interview experience isn't just about finding the right candidateâ€”it's about building a reputation as an employer that values and respects people throughout the hiring process. This approach not only improves candidate experience but also strengthens your company's brand in the market.

Whether you're a hiring manager, technical interviewer, or HR professional, remember that every interaction is an opportunity to showcase your company's values and create a lasting positive impression.
