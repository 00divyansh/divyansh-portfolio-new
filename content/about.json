  "description": "I'm a full-stack developer who loves to build web applications. I have been working with Vue.js and Nuxt.js for the past 3 years. I have experience in building web applications using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Firebase. I have also worked with Docker, GitHub Actions, Netlify, and Vercel for deployment. I love to write technical articles and share my knowledge with the community. I'm currently working on a new project using Nuxt 3 and I'm loving the writing experience. I'm excited to see what the future holds for Nuxt 3.",
